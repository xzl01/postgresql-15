    + Restrict visibility of pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs entries to
      the table owner (Nathan Bossart)

      These views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve
      columns the accessing user does not have permission to read.  View
      columns such as most_common_vals might expose security-relevant data.
      The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the interest
      of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views visible only
      to the owner of the associated table.

      (CVE-2024-4317)

      By itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd
      database clusters.  If you wish to apply this change in an existing
      cluster, you will need to do the following:

        In each database of the cluster, run the fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql script
        as superuser. In psql this would look like
          \i /usr/share/postgresql/15/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql
        Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script
        version.  It will not hurt to run the script more than once.

        Do not forget to include the template0 and template1 databases, or the
        vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.  To fix
        template0, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.  Do
        that with
          ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
        and then after fixing template0, undo it with
          ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

    * Tighten security restrictions within REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
      CONCURRENTLY (Heikki Linnakangas)

      One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
      restrictions.  If a materialized view's owner could persuade a superuser
      or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent refresh on that
      view, the view's owner could control code executed with the privileges
      of the user running REFRESH. Fix things so that all user-determined code
      is run as the view's owner, as expected.

    * Fix handling of unknown-type arguments in DISTINCT "any" aggregate
      functions (Tom Lane)

      This error led to a text-type value being interpreted as an unknown-type
      value (that is, a zero-terminated string) at runtime.  This could result
      in disclosure of server memory following the text value.

    * Detect integer overflow while computing new array dimensions
      (Tom Lane)

      When assigning new elements to array subscripts that are outside the
      current array bounds, an undetected integer overflow could occur in edge
      cases.  Memory stomps that are potentially exploitable for arbitrary
      code execution are possible, and so is disclosure of server memory.

    * Prevent the pg_signal_backend role from signalling background workers
      and autovacuum processes (Noah Misch, Jelte Fennema-Nio)

      The documentation says that pg_signal_backend
      cannot issue signals to superuser-owned processes.  It was able to
      signal these background processes, though, because they advertise a
      role OID of zero.  Treat that as indicating superuser ownership.
      The security implications of cancelling one of these process types
      are fairly small so far as the core code goes (we'll just start
      another one), but extensions might add background workers that are
      more vulnerable.

      Also ensure that the is_superuser parameter is set correctly in such
      processes.  No specific security consequences are known for that
      oversight, but it might be significant for some extensions.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Hemanth Sandrana and Mahendrakar
      Srinivasarao for reporting this problem. (CVE-2023-5870)

    * Fix misbehavior during recursive page split in GiST index build
      (Heikki Linnakangas)

      Fix a case where the location of a page downlink was incorrectly
      tracked, and introduce some logic to allow recovering from such
      situations rather than silently doing the wrong thing.  This error could
      result in incorrect answers from subsequent index searches. It may be
      advisable to reindex all GiST indexes after installing this update.

    * Prevent de-duplication of btree index entries for interval columns

      There are interval values that are distinguishable but compare equal,
      for example 24:00:00 and 1 day.  This breaks assumptions made by btree
      de-duplication, so interval columns need to be excluded from
      de-duplication.  This oversight can cause incorrect results from
      index-only scans.  Moreover, after updating amcheck will report an error
      for almost all such indexes.  Users should reindex any btree indexes on
      interval columns.

    + Disallow substituting a schema or owner name into an extension script if
      the name contains a quote, backslash, or dollar sign (Noah Misch)

      extensions.

      (CVE-2023-39417)

    + Fix MERGE to enforce row security policies properly (Dean Rasheed)
      When MERGE performs an UPDATE action, it should enforce any UPDATE or
      SELECT RLS policies defined on the target table, to be consistent with
      the way that a plain UPDATE with a WHERE clause works.  Instead it was
      enforcing INSERT RLS policies for both INSERT and UPDATE actions.
      In addition, when MERGE performs a DO NOTHING action, it applied the
      target table's DELETE RLS policies to existing rows, even though those
      rows are not being deleted.  While it's not a security problem, this
      could result in unwanted errors.
      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Dean Rasheed for reporting this problem.

    + Prevent CREATE SCHEMA from defeating changes in search_path
      (Report and fix by Alexander Lakhin, CVE-2023-2454)

      Within a CREATE SCHEMA command, objects in the prevailing search_path,
      as well as those in the newly-created schema, would be visible even
      within a called function or script that attempted to set a secure
      search_path.  This could allow any user having permission to create a
      schema to hijack the privileges of a security definer function or
      extension script.

    + Enforce row-level security policies correctly after inlining a
      set-returning function (Report by Wolfgang Walther, CVE-2023-2455)

      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling query,
      those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some cases
      involving re-using a cached plan under a different role. This could
      allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been invisible.

    + libpq can leak memory contents after GSSAPI transport encryption
      initiation fails (Jacob Champion)

      A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a
      not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos)
      transport encryption.  libpq will then copy that string, as well as
      following bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its
      error report. Depending on what the calling application does with the
      error report, this could result in disclosure of application memory
      contents.  There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading
      beyond the end of memory.  Fix by properly zero-terminating the server
      message. (CVE-2022-41862)
